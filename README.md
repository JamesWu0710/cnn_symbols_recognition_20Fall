# Machine_Learning-Fall2020
The final project of CSCI-SHU 360 Machine Learning for 2020Fall. Contributed by students from NYU Shanghai: James Wu (author), Sophia Li and Xingjian Gao.

There are several notes:
1) https://www.kaggle.com/xainano/handwrittenmathsymbols is the link from Kaggle where the team gathers the original data.
2) The data processing part is done locally. So to implement the algorithm locally, we need to change the corresponding directories.
3) The notebooks have detailed descripitons of the implementation details. For the algorithm part, see the final report attached.

The project is originally a final project from NYU Shanghai Undergraduate course, MATH-SHU 360, Machine Learning. Course instructors are Guo, Li and Tam, Wilson.
Thanks for their support and instructions on the course that finally lead to the completion of this project.
